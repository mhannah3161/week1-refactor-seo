# Week 1 Challange - Refactor for SEO

### About the challenge
Horiseon Marketing wanted a site that was more accessible to get a larger customer base. 
To do this I utilized semantic HTML and condenced quite a bit of extra CSS code. I also used alternete text for screenreaders. 
### How to Use
To be able to see what was done to improve the website, one must looking into the developer apps on Chrome by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect".
Inside of here is where all code can be seen. The size of the CSS file was cut in half, and semantic HTML is used.
